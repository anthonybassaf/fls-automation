PREFACE  
The Saudi Building Code General Requirements (SBC 201) provides minimum requirements for the 
public safety, health, and general welfare of the occupants of new and existing buildings and structures. 
The code primarily addresses structural strength, means of egress, sanitation, adequate lighting and 
ventilation, accessibility, energy conservation and life safety in regard to new and existing buildings, 
facilities and systems. The Code also prescribes minimum structural loading requirements for use in 
the design and construction of buildings and structural components. 
2015 International Building Code (IBC 2015), published by the International Code Council (ICC), is 
the base code in the development of this Code. Saudi Building Code National Committee (SBCNC) 
has made an agreement with the ICC to use their materials and modify them as per the local 
construction needs and regulatory requirements of Saudi Arabia. The ICC is not responsible or liable 
in any way to SBCNC or to any other party or entity for any modifications or changes that SBCNC 
makes to such documents. 
The contents of the current edition of the Code is substantially updated from its 2007 edition. Several 
new chapters are added, and old chapters are updated. The writing process of SBC 201-18 followed 
the methodology approved by the Saudi Building Code National Committee. Many changes and 
modifications were made in its base code (IBC 2015) to meet the local weather, materials, construction 
and regulatory requirements. 
The committees responsible for SBC 201 Code have taken all precautions to avoid ambiguities, 
omissions, and errors in the document. Despite these efforts, the users of SBC 201 may find 
information or requirements that may be subject to more than one interpretation or may be incomplete. 
The SBCNC alone possesses the authority and responsibility for updating, modifying and interpreting 
the Code. 
It is a common assumption  that engineering knowledge is a prerequisite in  understanding code 
provisions and requirements; thus,  the code  is oriented towards individuals who  possess the 
background knowledge to evaluate the significance and limitations of its content and 
recommendations.  They shall be able to  determine the applicability of all regulatory limitations before 
applying the Code and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. 
The requirements related to administration and enforcement of this Code are advisory only. SBCNC 
and governmental organizations, in charge of enforcing this Code, possess the authority to modify 
these administrative requirements.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTERS

SUMMARY OF CHAPTERS 
 
The following is a chapter-by-chapter synopsis of the scope and intent of the provisions of the Saudi 
Building Code-SBC 201. 
 
Chapter 1 Scope and Administration. Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of the code 
and describes how the code is to be applied and enforced. Chapter 1 is in two parts, Part 1— Scope 
and Application (Sections 101-102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections 103-116). 
Section 101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other 
SBCNC codes as applicable. Standards and codes are scoped to the extent referenced (see Section 
102.4). 
The building code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document and it cannot be 
effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of 
Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the jurisdiction having 
authority and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property 
owner. 
Chapter 2 Definitions. An alphabetical listing of all defined terms is located in Chapter 2. Defined 
terms that are pertinent to a specific chapter or section are also found in that chapter or section with a 
reference back to Chapter 2 for the definition. While a defined term may be listed in one chapter or 
another, the meaning is applicable throughout the code. 
Codes are technical documents and every word, term and punctuation mark can impact the meaning 
of the code text and the intended results. The code often uses terms that have a unique meaning in the 
code and the code meaning can differ substantially from the ordinarily understood meaning of the term 
as used outside of the code. Where understanding of a term’s definition is especially key to or necessary 
for understanding a particular code provision, the term is shown in italics wherever it appears in the 
code. 
The user of the code should be familiar with and consult this chapter because the definitions are 
essential to the correct interpretation of the code. Where a term is not defined, such terms shall have 
the ordinarily accepted meaning. 
Chapter 3 Use and Occupancy Classification. Chapter 3 provides for the classification of buildings, 
structures and parts thereof based on the purpose or purposes for which they are used. Section 302 
identifies the groups into which all buildings, structures and parts thereof must be classified. Sections 
303 through 312 identify the occupancy characteristics of each group classification. In some sections, 
specific group classifications having requirements in common are collectively organized such that one 
term applies to all. For example, Groups A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5 are individual groups for 
assembly-type buildings. The general term “Group A,” however, includes each of these individual 
groups. Other groups include Business (B), Educational (E), Factory (F-1, F-2), High Hazard (H-1, H-
2, H-3, H-4, H-5), Institutional (I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4), Mercantile (M), Residential (R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4), 
Storage (S-1, S-2) and Utility (U). In some occupancies, the smaller number means a higher hazard, 
but that is not always the case. 
Defining the use of the buildings is very important as it sets the tone for the remaining chapters of the 
code. Occupancy works with the height, area and construction type requirements in Chapters 5 and 6, 
as well as the special provisions in Chapter 4, to determine “equivalent risk,” or providing a reasonable 
level of protection or life safety for building occupants. The determination of equivalent risk involves 
three interdependent considerations: (1) the level of fire hazard associated with the specific occupancy 
of the facility; (2) the reduction of fire hazard by limiting the floor area and the height of the building

based on the fuel load (combustible contents and burnable building components); and (3) the level of 
overall fire resistance provided by the type of construction used for the building. The greater the 
potential fire hazards indicated as a function of the group, the lesser the height and area allowances for 
a particular construction type. 
Occupancy classification also plays a key part in organizing and prescribing the appropriate protection 
measures. As such, threshold requirements for fire protection and means of egress systems are based 
on occupancy classification (see Chapters 9 and 10). Other sections of the code also contain 
requirements respective to the classification of building groups. For example, Section 706 specifies 
requirements for fire wall fire-resistance ratings that are tied to the occupancy classification of a 
building and Section 803.11 contains interior finish requirements that are dependent upon the 
occupancy classification. The use of the space, rather than the occupancy of the building, is utilized 
for determining occupant loading (Section 1004) and live loading (Section 1607). 
Over the useful life of a building, the activities in the building will evolve and change. Where the 
provisions of the code address uses differently, moving from one activity to another or from one level 
of activity to another is, by definition, a change of occupancy. The new occupancy must be in 
compliance with the applicable provisions. 
Chapter 4 Special Detailed Requirements Based On Use and Occupancy. Chapter 4 contains the 
requirements for protecting special uses and occupancies, which are supplemental to the remainder of 
the code. Chapter 4 contains provisions that may alter requirements found elsewhere in the code; 
however, the general requirements of the code still apply unless modified within the chapter. For 
example, the height and area limitations established in Chapter 5 apply to all special occupancies unless 
Chapter 4 contains height and area limitations. In this case, the limitations in Chapter 4 supersede those 
in other sections. An example of this is the height and area limitations for open parking garages given 
in Section 406.5.4, which supersede the limitations given in Sections 504 and 506. 
In some instances, it may not be necessary to apply the provisions of Chapter 4. For example, if a 
covered mall building complies with the provisions of the code for Group M, Section 402 does not 
apply; however, other sections that address a use, process or operation must be applied to that specific 
occupancy, such as stages and platforms, special amusement buildings and hazardous materials 
(Sections 410, 411 and 414). 
The chapter includes requirements for buildings and conditions that apply to one or more groups, such 
as high-rise buildings, underground buildings or atriums. Special uses may also imply specific 
occupancies and operations, such as for Group H, hazardous materials, application of flammable 
finishes, drying rooms, organic coatings and combustible storage or hydrogen fuel gas rooms, all of 
which are coordinated with the SBC 801. Unique consideration is taken for special use areas, such as 
covered mall buildings, motor-vehicle-related occupancies, special amusement buildings and aircraft-
related occupancies. Special facilities within other occupancies are considered, such as stages and 
platforms, motion picture projection rooms, children’s play structures and storm shelters. Finally, in 
order that the overall package of protection features can be easily understood, unique considerations 
for specific occupancies are addressed: Groups I-1, I-2, I-3, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, ambulatory care 
facilities and live/work units. 
Chapter 5 General Building Heights and Areas. Chapter 5 contains the provisions that regulate the 
minimum type of construction for area limits and height limits based on the occupancy of the building. 
Height and area increases (including allowances for basements, mezzanines and equipment platforms) 
are permitted based on open frontage for fire department access, and the type of sprinkler protection 
provided and separation (Sections 503-506, 510). These thresholds are reduced for buildings over three 
stories in height in accordance with Sections 506.2.3 and 506.2.4. Provisions include the protection 
and/or separation of incidental uses (Table 509), accessory occupancies (Section 508.2) and mixed 
uses in the same building (Sections 506.2.2, 506.2.4, 508.3, 508.4 and 510). Unlimited area buildings 
are permitted in certain occupancies when they meet special provisions (Section 507).

SBC 201-CR-18

Tables 504.3, 504.4 and 506.2 are the keystones in setting thresholds for building size based on the 
building’s use and the materials with which it is constructed. If one then looks at Tables 504.3, 504.4 
and 506.2, the relationship among group classification, allowable heights and areas and types of 
construction becomes apparent. Respective to each group classification, the greater the fire resistance 
rating of structural elements, as represented by the type of construction, the greater the floor area and 
height allowances. The greater the potential fire hazards indicated as a function of the group, the lesser 
the height and area allowances for a particular construction type. In the 2018 edition, the table that 
once contained both height and area has been separated and these three new tables address the topics 
individually. In addition, the tables list criteria for buildings containing automatic sprinkler systems 
and those that do not. 
Chapter 6 Types of Construction. The interdependence of these fire safety considerations can be 
seen by first looking at Tables 601 and 602, which show the fire-resistance ratings of the principal 
structural elements comprising a building in relation to the five classifications for types of construction. 
Type I construction is the classification that generally requires the highest fire-resistance ratings for 
structural elements, whereas Type V construction, which is designated as a combustible type of 
construction, generally requires the least amount of fire-resistance-rated structural elements. The 
greater the potential fire hazards indicated as a function of the group, the lesser the height and area 
allowances for a particular construction type. Section 603 includes a list of combustible elements that 
can be part of a non-combustible building (Types I and II construction). 
Chapter 7 Fire and Smoke Protection Features. The provisions of Chapter 7 present the 
fundamental concepts of fire performance that all buildings are expected to achieve in some form. This 
chapter identifies the acceptable materials, techniques and methods by which proposed construction 
can be designed and evaluated against to determine a building’s ability to limit the impact of fire. The 
fire-resistance-rated construction requirements within Chapter 7 provide passive resistance to the 
spread and effects of fire. Types of separations addressed include fire walls, fire barriers, fire partitions, 
horizontal assemblies, smoke barriers and smoke partitions. A fire produces heat that can weaken 
structural components and smoke products that cause property damage and place occupants at risk. 
The requirements of Chapter 7 work in unison with height and area requirements (Chapter 5), active 
fire detection and suppression systems (Chapter 9) and occupant egress requirements (Chapter 10) to 
contain a fire should it occur while helping ensure occupants are able to safely exit. 
Chapter 8 Interior Finishes. This chapter contains the performance requirements for controlling fire 
growth within buildings by restricting interior finish and decorative materials. Past fire experience has 
shown that interior finish and decorative materials are key elements in the development and spread of 
fire. The provisions of Chapter 8 require materials used as interior finishes and decorations to meet 
certain flame-spread index or flame-propagation criteria based on the relative fire hazard associated 
with the occupancy. As smoke is also a hazard associated with fire, this chapter contains limits on the 
smoke development characteristics of interior finishes. The performance of the material is evaluated 
based on test standards. 
Chapter 9 Fire Protection Systems. Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active 
systems of fire protection equipment to perform the following functions: detect a fire; alert the 
occupants or fire department of a fire emergency; and control smoke and control or extinguish the fire. 
Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building, 
because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a 
specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 
of the Saudi Fire Code (SBC 801); however, the SBC 801 Chapter 9 also contains periodic testing 
criteria that are not contained in the SBC. In addition, the special fire protection system requirements 
based on use and occupancy found in SBC Chapter 4 are duplicated in SBC 801 Chapter 9 as a user 
convenience. 
Chapter 10 Means of Egress. The general criteria set forth in Chapter 10 regulating the design of the 
means of egress are established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing

timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is 
utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for 
all occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system (i.e., exit access, exits and exit discharge) 
and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The 
requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. 
Functional and operational characteristics also are specified for the components that will permit their 
safe use without special knowledge or effort. The means of egress protection requirements work in 
coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), 
interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous 
others, all having an impact on life safety. Chapter 10 of the SBC 201 is duplicated in Chapter 10 of 
the SBC 801; however, the SBC 801 contains one additional section on the means of egress system in 
existing buildings. 
Chapter 11 Accessibility. Chapter 11 contains provisions that set forth requirements for accessibility 
of buildings and their associated sites and facilities for people with physical disabilities. The 
fundamental philosophy of the code on the subject of accessibility is that everything is required to be 
accessible. This is reflected in the basic applicability requirement (see Section 1103.1). The code’s 
scoping requirements then address the conditions under which accessibility is not required in terms of 
exceptions to this general mandate. While the SBC 201 contains scoping provisions for accessibility 
(e.g., what, where and how many), ICC/ANSI A117.1, Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, 
is the referenced standard for the technical provisions (i.e., how). 
There are many accessibility issues that not only benefit people with disabilities, but also provide a 
tangible benefit to people without disabilities. This type of requirement can be set forth in the code as 
generally applicable without necessarily identifying it specifically as an accessibility-related issue. 
Such a requirement would then be considered as having been “mainstreamed.” For example, visible 
alarms are located in Chapter 9 and accessible means of egress and ramp requirements are addressed 
in Chapter 10. 
Accessibility criteria for existing buildings are addressed in the Saudi Existing Building Code (SBC 
901). 
Appendix E is supplemental information included in the code to address accessibility for items in the 
Standards for Accessible Design that were not typically enforceable through the standard traditional 
building code enforcement approach system (e.g., beds, room signage). The Saudi Residential Code 
(SBC 1101) references Chapter 11 for accessibility provisions; therefore, this chapter may be 
applicable to housing covered under the SBC 1101. 
Chapter 12 Interior Environment. Chapter 12 provides minimum standards for the interior 
environment of a building. The standards address the minimum sizes of spaces, minimum temperature 
levels, and minimum light and ventilation levels. The collection of requirements addresses limiting 
sound transmission through walls, ventilation of attic spaces and under floor spaces (crawl spaces). 
Finally, the chapter provides minimum standards for toilet and bathroom construction, including 
privacy shielding and standards for walls, partitions and floors to resist water intrusion and damage. 
Chapter 13 Energy Efficiency. The purpose of Chapter 13 is to provide minimum design 
requirements that will promote efficient utilization of energy in buildings. The requirements are 
directed toward the design of building envelopes with adequate thermal resistance and low air leakage, 
and toward the design and selection of mechanical, water heating, electrical and illumination systems 
that promote effective use of depletable energy resources. For the specifics of these criteria, Chapter 
13 requires design and construction in compliance with the Saudi Energy Conservation Code (SBC 
601 and SBC 602). 
Chapter 14 Exterior Walls. This chapter addresses requirements for exterior walls of buildings. 
Minimum standards for wall covering materials, installation of wall coverings and the ability of the 
wall to provide weather protection are provided. This chapter also requires exterior walls that are close 
to lot lines, or that are bearing walls for certain types of construction, to comply with the minimum

fire-resistance ratings specified in Chapters 6 and 7. The installation of each type of wall covering, be 
it wood, masonry, vinyl, metal composite material or an exterior insulation and finish system, is critical 
to its long-term performance in protecting the interior of the building from the elements and the spread 
of fire. Limitations on the use of combustible materials on exterior building elements such as balconies, 
eaves, decks and architectural trim are also addressed in this chapter. 
Chapter 15 Roof Assemblies and Roof-top Structures. Chapter 15 provides standards for both roof 
assemblies as well as structures that sit on top of the roof of buildings. The criteria address roof 
construction and covering which includes the weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most 
circumstances, a fire-resistant barrier. The chapter is prescriptive in nature and is based on decades of 
experience with various traditional materials, but it also addresses newer products such as photovoltaic 
shingles. These prescriptive rules are very important for satisfying performance of one type of roof 
covering or another. Section 1510 addresses roof-top structures, including penthouses, tanks, towers 
and spires. Roof-top penthouses larger than prescribed in this chapter must be treated as a story under 
Chapter 5. 
Chapter 16 Structural Design. Chapter 16 prescribes minimum structural loading requirements for 
use in the design and construction of buildings and structural components. It includes minimum design 
loads, assignment of risk categories, as well as permitted design methodologies. Standards are 
provided for minimum design loads (live, dead, wind, rain, flood and earthquake as well as the required 
load combinations). The application of these loads and adherence to the serviceability criteria will 
enhance the protection of life and property. Structural design needs to address the conditions of the 
site and location. Therefore, maps are provided of rainfall, seismic and wind criteria in different 
regions. 
Chapter 17 Special Inspections and Tests. Chapter 17 provides a variety of procedures and criteria 
for testing materials and assemblies, labeling materials and assemblies and special inspection of 
structural assemblies. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special 
inspection where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation. It also spells out additional 
responsibilities for the owner, contractor, design professionals and special inspectors. Proper assembly 
of structural components, proper quality of materials used and proper application of materials are 
essential to ensuring that a building, once constructed, complies with the structural and fire-resistance 
minimums of the code and the approved design. To determine this compliance often requires 
continuous or frequent inspection and testing. Chapter 17 establishes standards for special inspection, 
testing and reporting of the work to the building official. 
Chapter 18 Soils and Foundations. Chapter 18 provides criteria for geotechnical and structural 
considerations in the selection, design and installation of foundation systems to support the loads from 
the structure above. The chapter includes requirements for soils investigation and site preparation for 
receiving a foundation, including the allowed load-bearing values for soils and for protecting the 
foundation from water intrusion. Section 1808 addresses the basic requirements for all foundation 
types. Later sections address foundation requirements that are specific to shallow foundations and deep 
foundations. Due care must be exercised in the planning and design of foundation systems based on 
obtaining sufficient soils information, the use of accepted engineering procedures, experience and 
good technical judgment. 
Chapter 19 Concrete. This chapter provides minimum accepted practices for the design and 
construction of buildings and structural components using concrete—both plain and reinforced. 
Chapter 19 relies primarily on the reference to SBC 304, Building Code Requirements for Structural 
Concrete. The chapter also includes references to additional standards. Structural concrete must be 
designed and constructed to comply with this code and all listed standards. There are specific sections 
of the chapter addressing concrete slabs, anchorage to concrete and shotcrete. Because of the variable 
properties of material and numerous design and construction options available in the uses of concrete, 
due care and control throughout the construction process is necessary.

Chapter 20 Aluminum. Chapter 20 contains standards for the use of aluminum in building 
construction. Only the structural applications of aluminum are addressed. The chapter does not address 
the use of aluminum in specialty products such as storefront or window framing or architectural 
hardware. The use of aluminum in heating, ventilating or air-conditioning systems is addressed in the 
Saudi Mechanical Code (SBC 501). The chapter references national standards from the Aluminum 
Association for use of aluminum in building construction, AA ASM 35, Aluminum Sheet Metal Work 
in Building Construction, and AA ADM 1, Aluminum Design Manual. By utilizing the standards set 
forth, a proper application of this material can be obtained. 
Chapter 21 Masonry. This chapter provides comprehensive and practical requirements for masonry 
construction. The provisions of Chapter 21 require minimum accepted practices and the use of 
standards for the design and construction of masonry structures. The provisions address: material 
specifications and test methods; types of wall construction; criteria for engineered and empirical 
designs; and required details of construction, including the execution of construction. Masonry design 
methodologies including allowable stress design, strength design and empirical design are covered by 
provisions of the chapter. Also addressed are masonry fireplaces and chimneys, masonry heaters and 
glass unit masonry. Fire-resistant construction using masonry is also required to comply with Chapter 
7. Masonry foundations are also subject to the requirements of Chapter 18. 
Chapter 22 Steel. Chapter 22 provides the requirements necessary for the design and construction of 
structural steel (including composite construction), cold-formed steel, steel joists, steel cable structures 
and steel storage racks. The chapter specifies appropriate design and construction standards for these 
types of structures. It also provides a road map of the applicable technical requirements for steel 
structures. Because steel is a noncombustible building material, it is commonly associated with Types 
I and II construction; however, it is permitted to be used in all types of construction. Chapter 22 
requires that the design and use of steel materials be in accordance with the specifications and standards 
of the Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization (SASO), American Institute of Steel 
Construction, the American Iron and Steel Institute, the Steel Joist Institute and the American Society 
of Civil Engineers. 
Chapter 23 Wood. This chapter provides minimum requirements for the design of buildings and 
structures that use wood and wood-based products. The chapter is organized around three design 
methodologies: allowable stress design (ASD), load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and 
conventional light-frame construction. Included in the chapter are references to design and 
manufacturing standards for various wood and wood-based products; general construction 
requirements; design criteria for lateral force-resisting systems and specific requirements for the 
application of the three design methods. In general, only Type III, IV or V buildings may be 
constructed of wood. 
Chapter 24 Glass and Glazing. This chapter establishes regulations for glass and glazing used in 
buildings and structures that, when installed, are subjected to wind, snow and dead loads. Engineering 
and design requirements are included in the chapter. Additional structural requirements are found in 
Chapter 16. Another concern of this chapter is glass and glazing used in areas where it is likely to be 
impacted by the occupants. Section 2406 identifies hazardous locations where glazing installed must 
either be safety glazing or blocked to prevent human impact. Safety glazing must meet stringent 
standards and be appropriately marked or identified. Additional requirements are provided for glass 
and glazing in guards, handrails, elevator hoistways and elevator cars, as well as in athletic facilities. 
Chapter 25 Gypsum Board, Gypsum Panel Products and Plaster. Chapter 25 contains the 
provisions and referenced standards that regulate the design, construction and quality of gypsum board, 
gypsum panel products and plaster. It also addresses reinforced gypsum concrete. These represent the 
most common interior and exterior finish materials in the building industry. This chapter primarily 
addresses quality-control-related issues with regard to material specifications and installation 
requirements. Most products are manufactured under the control of industry standards. The building 
official or inspector primarily needs to verify that the appropriate product is used and properly installed

for the intended use and location. While often simply used as wall and ceiling coverings, proper design 
and application are necessary to provide weather resistance and required fire protection for both 
structural and nonstructural building components. 
Chapter 26 Plastic. The use of plastics in building construction and components is addressed in 
Chapter 26. This chapter provides standards addressing foam plastic insulation, foam plastics used as 
interior finish and trim, and other plastic veneers used on the inside or outside of a building. Plastic 
siding is regulated by Chapter 14. Sections 2606 through 2611 address the use of light-transmitting 
plastics in various configurations such as walls, roof panels, skylights, signs and as glazing. 
Requirements for the use of fiber-reinforced polymers, fiberglass-reinforced polymers and reflective 
plastic core insulation are also contained in this chapter. Additionally, requirements specific to the use 
of wood-plastic composites and plastic lumber are contained in this chapter. Some plastics exhibit 
rapid flame spread and heavy smoke density characteristics when exposed to fire. Exposure to the heat 
generated by a fire can cause some plastics to deform, which can affect their performance. The 
requirements and limitations of this chapter are necessary to control the use of plastic and foam plastic 
products such that they do not compromise the safety of building occupants. 
Chapter 27 Electrical. Since electrical systems and components are an integral part of almost all 
structures, it is necessary for the code to address the installation of such systems. For this purpose, 
Chapter 27 references the National Electrical Code (NEC) and SBC 401. In addition, Section 2702 
addresses emergency and standby power requirements. Such systems must comply with the Saudi Fire 
Code (SBC 801) and referenced standards. This section also provides references to the various code 
sections requiring emergency and standby power, such as high-rise buildings and buildings containing 
hazardous materials. 
Chapter 28 Mechanical Systems. Nearly all buildings will include mechanical systems. This chapter 
provides references to the Saudi Mechanical Code (SBC 501) and the Saudi Fuel Gas Code (SBC 
1201) for the design and installation of mechanical systems. In addition, Chapter 21 of this code is 
referenced for masonry chimneys, fireplaces and barbecues. 
Chapter 29 Plumbing Systems. Chapter 29 regulates the minimum number of plumbing fixtures that 
must be provided for every type of building. This chapter also regulates the location of the required 
fixtures in various types of buildings. This section requires separate facilities for males and females 
except for certain types of small occupancies. The regulations in this chapter come directly from 
Chapters 3 and 4 of the Saudi Plumbing Code (SBC 701). 
Chapter 30 Elevators and Conveying Systems. Chapter 30 provides standards for the installation of 
elevators into buildings. Referenced standards provide the requirements for the elevator system and 
mechanisms. Detailed standards are provided in the chapter for hoist way enclosures, machine rooms 
and requirements for sizing of elevators.  
Chapter 31 Special Construction. Chapter 31 contains a collection of regulations for a variety of 
unique structures and architectural features. Pedestrian walkways and tunnels connecting two 
buildings are addressed in Section 3104. Membrane and air-supported structures are addressed by 
Section 3102. Safeguards for swimming pool safety are found in Section 3109. Standards for 
temporary structures, including permit requirements are provided in Section 3103. Structures as varied 
as awnings, marquees, signs, telecommunication and broadcast towers and automatic vehicular gates 
are also addressed (see Sections 3105 through 3108 and 3110). 
Chapter 32 Encroachments into the Public Right-of-way. Buildings and structures from time to 
time are designed to extend over a property line and into the public right-of-way. Local regulations 
outside of the building code usually set limits to such encroachments, and such regulations take 
precedence over the provisions of this chapter. Standards are provided for encroachments below grade 
for structural support, vaults and areaways. Encroachments above grade are divided into below 2.4 
meters, 2.4 meters to 4.5 meters, and above 4.5 meters, because of headroom and vehicular height 
issues. This includes steps, columns, awnings, canopies, marquees, signs, windows and balconies.

Similar architectural features above grade are also addressed. Pedestrian walkways must also comply 
with Chapter 31. 
Chapter 33 Safeguards During Construction. Chapter 33 provides safety requirements during 
construction and demolition of buildings and structures. These requirements are intended to protect 
the public from injury and adjoining property from damage. In addition, the chapter provides for the 
progressive installation and operation of exit stairways and standpipe systems during construction. 
Chapter 34 Reserved. During the code development cycle the membership voted to delete Chapter 
34, Existing Structures, from the SBC 201 and reference the SBC 901. The provisions that were in 
Chapter 34 will appear in the Saudi Existing Building Code (SBC 901). Sections 3402 through 3411 
are repeated as SBC 901 Chapter 4 and Section 3412 as Chapter 14. 
Chapter 35 Referenced Standards. The code contains numerous references to standards that are used 
to regulate materials and methods of construction. Chapter 35 contains a comprehensive list of all 
standards that are referenced in the code, including the appendices. The standards are part of the code 
to the extent of the reference to the standard (see Section 102.4). Compliance with the referenced 
standard is necessary for compliance with this code. By providing specifically adopted standards, the 
construction and installation requirements necessary for compliance with the code can be readily 
determined. The basis for code compliance is, therefore, established and available on an equal basis to 
the building code official, contractor, designer and owner. 
Chapter 35 is organized in a manner that makes it easy to locate specific standards. It lists all of the 
referenced standards, alphabetically, by acronym of the promulgating agency of the standard. Each 
agency’s standards are then listed in either alphabetical or numeric order based upon the standard 
identification. The list also contains the title of the standard; the edition (date) of the standard 
referenced; any addenda included as part of the SBCNC adoption; and the section or sections of this 
code that reference the standard. 
Appendices. Appendices are provided in the SBC 201 to offer optional or supplemental criteria to the 
provisions in the main chapters of the code. Appendices provide additional information for 
administration of the Department of Building Safety as well as standards not typically administered 
by all building departments. Appendices have the same force and effect as the first 35 chapters of the 
SBC only when explicitly adopted by the jurisdiction. 
Appendix A Employee Qualifications. Effective administration and enforcement of the family of 
SBCNC Codes depends on the training and expertise of the personnel employed by the jurisdiction 
and his or her knowledge of the codes. Section 103 of the code establishes the Department of Building 
Safety and calls for the appointment of a building official and deputies such as plans examiners and 
inspectors. Appendix A provides standards for experience, training and certification for the building 
official and the other staff mentioned in Chapter 1. 
Appendix B Board of Appeals. Section 113 of Chapter 1 requires the establishment of a board of 
appeals to hear appeals regarding determinations made by the building official. Appendix B provides 
qualification standards for members of the board as well as operational procedures of such board. 
Appendix C Group U—Agricultural Buildings. Appendix C provides a more liberal set of standards 
for the construction of agricultural buildings, rather than strictly following the Utility building 
provision, reflective of their specific usage and limited occupant load. The provisions of the appendix, 
when adopted, allow reasonable heights and areas commensurate with the risk of agricultural 
buildings. 
Appendix D Fire Districts. Fire districts have been a tool used to limit conflagration hazards in areas 
of a city with intense and concentrated development. More frequently used under the model codes that 
preceded the Saudi Building Code (SBC 201), the appendix is provided to allow jurisdictions to 
continue the designation and use of fire districts. Fire district standards restrict certain occupancies 
within the district, as well as setting higher minimum construction standards. 
Appendix E Supplementary Accessibility Requirements. Appendix E includes scoping 
requirements for Accessible Design that are not in Chapter 11 and not otherwise mentioned or

mainstreamed throughout the code. Items in the appendix address subjects not typically addressed in 
building codes (e.g., beds, room signage, transportation facilities). 
Appendix F Rodent proofing. The provisions of this appendix are minimum mechanical methods to 
prevent the entry of rodents into a building. These standards, when used in conjunction with cleanliness 
and maintenance programs, can significantly reduce the potential of rodents invading a building. 
Appendix H Signs. Appendix H gathers in one place the various code standards that regulate the 
construction and protection of outdoor signs. Whenever possible, the appendix provides standards in 
performance language, thus allowing the widest possible application. 
Appendix I Patio Covers. Appendix I provides standards applicable to the construction and use of 
patio covers. It is limited in application to patio covers accessory to dwelling units. Covers of patios 
and other outdoor areas associated with restaurants, mercantile buildings, offices, nursing homes or 
other nondwelling occupancies would be subject to standards in the main code and not this appendix. 
Appendix J Grading. Appendix J provides standards for the grading of properties. The appendix also 
provides standards for administration and enforcement of a grading program including permit and 
inspection requirements. It is intended to provide consistent and uniform code requirements anywhere 
grading is considered an issue.

SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY OF THE SAUDI 
BUILDING CODE 
PART 1—SCOPE AND APPLICATION 
SECTION 101  GENERAL 
101.1  Title. These regulations shall be known as 
the Saudi Building Code, SBC 201, hereinafter 
referred to as “this code.” 
101.2  Scope. The provisions of this code shall 
apply to the construction, alteration, relocation, 
enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use 
and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and 
demolition of every building or structure or any 
appurtenances connected or attached to such 
buildings or structures. 
Exception: 
Detached 
one- 
and 
two-family 
dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings 
(townhouses) not more than three stories above 
grade plane in height with a separate means of 
egress, and their accessory structures not more than 
three stories above grade plane in height, shall 
comply with SBC 1101. 
101.2.1  Appendices. Provisions in the appendices 
shall not apply unless specifically adopted. 
101.3  Intent. The purpose of this code is to 
establish the minimum requirements to provide a 
reasonable level of safety, public health and general 
welfare through structural strength, means of egress 
facilities, stability, sanitation, adequate light and 
ventilation, energy conservation, and safety to life 
and property from fire and other hazards attributed 
to the built environment and to provide a reasonable 
level of safety to fire fighters and emergency 
responders during emergency operations. 
101.4  Referenced codes. The other codes listed 
in Sections 101.4.1 through 101.4.10 and 
referenced elsewhere in this code shall be

covering consisting of a woven textile backing, an 
expanded vinyl base coat layer and a nonexpanded 
vinyl skin coat. The expanded base coat layer is a 
homogeneous vinyl layer that contains a blowing 
agent. During processing, the blowing agent 
decomposes, causing this layer to expand by 
forming closed cells. The total thickness of the wall 
covering is approximately 1.4 mm to 1.78 mm.  
EXPLOSION. An effect produced by the sudden 
violent expansion of gases, which may be 
accompanied by a shock wave or disruption, or 
both, of enclosing materials or structures. An 
explosion could result from any of the following:  
1. Chemical changes such as rapid oxidation, 
deflagration or detonation, decomposition of 
molecules and runaway polymerization 
(usually detonations). 
2. Physical changes such as pressure tank 
ruptures. 
3. Atomic changes (nuclear fission or fusion).  
 
EXPLOSIVE. A chemical compound, mixture or 
device, the primary or common purpose of which is 
to function by explosion. The term includes, but is 
not limited to, dynamite, black powder, pellet 
powder, initiating explosives, detonators, safety 
fuses, squibs, detonating cord, igniter cord, igniters 
and display fireworks, 1.3G.  
The term “explosive” includes any material 
determined to be within the scope of USC Title 18: 
Chapter 40 and also includes any material classified 
as an explosive other than consumer fireworks, 
1.4G by the hazardous materials regulations of 
DOTn 49 CFR Parts 100-185. 
 
High explosive. Explosive material, such as 
dynamite, which can be caused to detonate by 
means of a No. 8 test blasting cap when unconfined.  
Low explosive. Explosive material that will burn or 
deflagrate when ignited. It is characterized by a rate 
of reaction that is less than the speed of sound. 
Examples of low explosives include, but are not 
limited to, black powder; safety fuse; igniters; 
igniter cord; fuse lighters; fireworks, 1.3G and 
propellants, 1.3C.  
Mass-detonating explosives. Division 1.1, 1.2 and 
1.5 explosives alone or in combination, or loaded 
into various types of ammunition or containers, 
most of which can be expected to explode virtually 
instantaneously when a small portion is subjected to 
fire, severe concussion, impact, the impulse of an 
initiating agent or the effect of a considerable 
discharge of energy from without. Materials that 
react in this manner represent a mass explosion 
hazard. Such an explosive will normally cause 
severe structural damage to adjacent objects. 
Explosive propagation could occur immediately to 
other items of ammunition and explosives stored 
sufficiently close to and not adequately protected 
from the initially exploding pile with a time interval 
short enough so that two or more quantities must be 
considered as one for quantity-distance purposes.  
UN/DOTn Class 1 explosives. The former 
classification system used by DOTn included the 
terms “high” and “low” explosives as defined 
herein. The following terms further define 
explosives under the current system applied by 
DOTn for all explosive materials defined as hazard 
Class 1 materials. Compatibility group letters are 
used in concert with the division to specify further 
limitations on each division noted (i.e., the letter G 
identifies the material as a pyrotechnic substance or 
article containing a pyrotechnic substance and 
similar materials).  
Division 1.1. Explosives that have a mass explosion 
hazard. A mass explosion is one which affects 
almost the entire load instantaneously. 
Division 1.2. Explosives that have a projection 
hazard but not a mass explosion hazard.  
Division 1.3. Explosives that have a fire hazard and 
either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection 
hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard.  
Division 1.4. Explosives that pose a minor 
explosion hazard. The explosive effects are largely 
confined to the package and no projection of 
fragments of appreciable size or range is to be 
expected. An external fire must not cause virtually 
instantaneous explosion of almost the entire 
contents of the package.  
Division 1.5. Very insensitive explosives. This 
division is comprised of substances that have a mass 
explosion hazard, but that are so insensitive there is 
very little probability of initiation or of transition 
from burning to detonation under normal conditions 
of transport.  
Division 1.6. Extremely insensitive articles which 
do not have a mass explosion hazard. This division 
is comprised of articles that contain only extremely 
insensitive detonating substances and which 
demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental

TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION 
 
SECTION 601  GENERAL 
601.1  Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall 
control the classification of buildings as to type of 
construction. 
 
SECTION 602  CONSTRUCTION 
CLASSIFICATION 
602.1  General. Buildings and structures erected 
or to be erected, altered or extended in height or area 
shall be classified in one of the five construction 
types defined in Sections 602.2 through 602.5. The 
building elements shall have a fire-resistance rating 
not less than that specified in Table 601 and exterior 
walls shall have a fire-resistance rating not less 
than that specified in Table 602. Where required to 
have a fire-resistance rating by Table 601, building 
elements shall comply with the applicable 
provisions of Section 703.2. The protection of 
openings, ducts and air transfer openings in 
building elements shall not be required unless 
required by other provisions of this code. 
602.1.1  Minimum requirements. A building or 
portion thereof shall not be required to conform to 
the details of a type of construction higher than that 
type which meets the minimum requirements based 
on occupancy even though certain features of such 
a building actually conform to a higher type of 
construction. 
602.2  Types I and II. Types I and II construction 
are those types of construction in which the building 
elements listed in Tables 601 are of noncombustible 
materials, except as permitted in Section 4.3 and 
elsewhere in this code. 
602.3  Type III. Type III construction is that type 
of construction in which the exterior walls are of 
noncombustible materials and the interior building 
elements are of any material permitted by this code. 
Fire-retardant-treated wood framing complying 
with Section 2303.2 shall be permitted within 
exterior wall assemblies of a 2-hour rating or less. 
602.4  Type IV. Type IV construction (Heavy 
Timber, HT) is that type of construction in which 
the exterior walls are of noncombustible materials 
and the interior building elements are of solid or 
laminated wood without concealed spaces. The 
details of Type IV construction shall comply with 
the provisions of this section and Section 2304.11. 
Exterior walls complying with Section 602.4.1 or 
602.4.2 shall be permitted. Minimum solid sawn 
nominal dimensions are required for structures built 
using Type IV construction (HT). For glued-
laminated members and structural composite 
lumber (SCL) members, the equivalent net finished 
width and depths corresponding to the minimum 
nominal width and depths of solid sawn lumber are 
required as specified in Table 602.4. Cross-
laminated timber (CLT) dimensions used in this 
section are actual dimensions.

timber 
in 
exterior 
walls. Cross-laminated timber complying with 
SBC 301 shall be permitted within exterior wall 
assemblies with a 2-hour rating or less, provided the 
exterior surface of the cross-laminated timber is 
protected by one the following: 
1. Fire-retardant-treated 
wood 
sheathing 
complying with Section 2303.2 and not less 
than 12 mm thick; 
2. Gypsum board not less than 12 mm thick; or

laminated arches for roof construction, which 
spring from the floor line or from grade and do not 
support floor loads, shall have members not less 
than 150 mm nominal in width and have not less 
than 200 mm nominal in depth for the lower half of 
the height and not less than 150 mm nominal in 
depth for the upper half. Framed or glued-laminated 
arches for roof construction that spring from the top 
of walls or wall abutments, framed timber trusses 
and other roof framing, which do not support floor 
loads, shall have members not less than 100 mm 
nominal in width and not less than 150 mm nominal 
in depth. Spaced members shall be permitted to be 
composed of two or more pieces not less than 75 
mm nominal in thickness where blocked solidly 
throughout their intervening spaces or where spaces 
are tightly closed by a continuous wood cover plate 
of not less than 50 mm nominal in thickness secured 
to the underside of the members. Splice plates shall 
be not less than 75 mm nominal in thickness. Where 
protected by approved automatic sprinklers under 
the roof deck, framing members shall be not less 
than 75 mm nominal in width. 
602.4.6  Floors. Floors shall be without concealed 
spaces. Wood floors shall be constructed in 
accordance with Section 602.4.6.1 or 602.4.6.2.

SECTION 703  FIRE-RESISTANCE 
RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS 
703.1  Scope. Materials prescribed herein for fire 
resistance shall conform to the requirements of this 
chapter. 
703.2  Fire-resistance 
ratings. 
The 
fire-
resistance rating of building elements, components 
or assemblies shall be determined in accordance 
with the test procedures set forth in ASTM E 119 or 
UL 263 or in accordance with Section 703.3. The 
fire-resistance rating of penetrations and fire-

# Page 183

CHAPTER 7  -FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES 
 
SBC 201-CR-18 
157 
 
resistant joint systems shall be determined in 
accordance Sections 714 and 715, respectively. 
703.2.1  Nonsymmetrical 
wall 
construction. 
Interior walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical 
construction shall be tested with both faces exposed 
to the furnace, and the assigned fire-resistance 
rating shall be the shortest duration obtained from 
the two tests conducted in compliance with ASTM 
E 119 or UL 263. Where evidence is furnished to 
show that the wall was tested with the least fire-
resistant side exposed to the furnace, subject to 
acceptance of the building official, the wall need not 
be subjected to tests from the opposite side (see 
Section 705.5 for exterior walls). 
703.2.2  Combustible components. Combustible 
aggregates are permitted in gypsum and Portland 
cement concrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated 
construction. Any component material or admixture 
is permitted in assemblies if the resulting tested 
assembly meets the fire-resistance test requirements 
of this code. 
703.2.3  Restrained classification. Fire-resistance-
rated assemblies tested under ASTM E 119 or UL 
263 shall not be considered to be restrained unless 
evidence satisfactory to the building official is 
furnished by the registered design professional 
showing that the construction qualifies for a 
restrained classification in accordance with ASTM 
E 119 or UL 263. Restrained construction shall be 
identified on the construction documents. 
703.2.4  Supplemental features. Where materials, 
systems or devices that have not been tested as part 
of a fire-resistance-rated assembly are incorporated 
into the building element, component or assembly, 
sufficient data shall be made available to the 
building official to show that the required fire-
resistance rating is not reduced. 
703.2.5  Exterior bearing walls. In determining the 
fire-resistance rating of exterior bearing walls, 
compliance with the ASTM E 119 or UL 263 
criteria for unexposed surface temperature rise and 
ignition of cotton waste due to passage of flame or 
gases is required only for a period of time 
corresponding to the required fire-resistance rating 
of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same fire 
separation distance, and in a building of the same 
group. Where the fire-resistance rating determined 
in accordance with this exception exceeds the fire-
resistance rating determined in accordance with 
ASTM E 119 or UL 263, the fire exposure time 
period, water pressure and application duration 
criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E 119 or 
UL 263 shall be based on the fire-resistance rating 
determined in accordance with this section. 
703.3  Methods for determining fire resistance. 
The application of any of the methods listed in this 
section shall be based on the fire exposure and 
acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E 119 or UL 
263. The required fire resistance of a building 
element, component or assembly shall be permitted 
to be established by any of the following methods 
or procedures: 
1. Fire-resistance 
designs 
documented 
in 
approved sources. 
2. Prescriptive designs of fire-resistance-rated 
building elements, components or assemblies 
as prescribed in Section 721. 
3. Calculations in accordance with Section 722. 
4. Engineering analysis based on a comparison 
of 
building 
element, 
component 
or 
assemblies designs having fire-resistance 
ratings as determined by the test procedures 
set forth in ASTM E 119 or UL 263. 
5. Alternative protection methods as allowed by 
Section 104.11. 
6. Fire-resistance designs certified by an 
approved agency. 
 
703.4  Automatic 
sprinklers. 
Under 
the 
prescriptive fire-resistance requirements of this 
code, the fire-resistance rating of a building 
element, component or assembly 
shall be 
established without the use of automatic sprinklers 
or any other fire suppression system being 
incorporated as part of the assembly tested in 
accordance with the fire exposure, procedures and 
acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E 119 or UL 
263. However, this section shall not prohibit or limit 
the duties and powers of the building official 
allowed by SBC 100. 
703.5  Noncombustibility 
tests. 
The 
tests 
indicated in Sections 703.5.1 and 703.5.2 shall 
serve as criteria for acceptance of building materials 
as set forth in Sections 602.2, 602.3 and 602.4 in 
Type I, II, III and IV constructions. The term 
“noncombustible” does not apply to the flame 
spread characteristics of interior finish or trim 
materials. A material shall not be classified as a 
noncombustible building construction material if it 
is subject to an increase in combustibility or flame 
spread beyond the limitations herein established

structural base of noncombustible material as 
determined in accordance with Section 703.5.1 with 
a surfacing not more than 3.2 mm thick that has a 
flame spread index not greater than 50 when tested 
in accordance with ASTM E 84 or UL 723 shall be 
acceptable as noncombustible materials. 
703.6  Fire-resistance-rated 
glazing. 
Fire-
resistance-rated glazing, when tested in accordance 
with ASTM E 119 or UL 263 and complying with 
the requirements of Section 707, shall be permitted. 
Fire-resistance-rated glazing shall bear a label 
marked in accordance with Table 716.3 issued by 
an agency and shall be permanently identified on

722.1.1  Definitions.  The following terms are 
defined in Chapter 2: 
722.2  Concrete assemblies. The provisions of 
this section contain procedures by which the fire-
resistance ratings of concrete assemblies are 
established by calculations. 
722.2.1  Concrete walls. Cast-in-place and precast 
concrete walls shall comply with Section 722.2.1.1. 
Multiwythe concrete walls shall comply with 
Section 722.2.1.2. Joints between precast panels 
shall comply with Section 722.2.1.3. Concrete walls 
with gypsum wallboard or plaster finish shall 
comply with Section 722.2.1.4. 
722.2.1.1  
Cast-in-place or precast walls. 
The minimum equivalent thicknesses of cast-in-
place or precast concrete walls for fire-resistance 
ratings of 1 hour to 4 hours are shown in Table 
722.2.1.1. For solid walls with flat vertical surfaces, 
the equivalent thickness is the same as the actual

thickness. The values in Table 722.2.1.1 apply to 
plain, reinforced or prestressed concrete walls. 
722.2.1.1.1  
Hollow-core precast wall panels. 
For hollow-core precast concrete wall panels in 
which the cores are of constant cross section 
throughout the length, calculation of the equivalent 
thickness by dividing the net cross-sectional area 
(the gross cross section minus the area of the cores) 
of the panel by its width shall be permitted 
722.2.1.1.2  
Core spaces filled. Where all of 
the core spaces of hollow-core wall panels are filled 
with loose-fill material, such as expanded shale, 
clay or slag, or vermiculite or perlite, the fire-
resistance rating of the wall is the same as that of a 
solid wall of the same concrete type and of the same 
overall thickness. 
722.2.1.1.3  
Tapered cross sections. The 
thickness of panels with tapered cross sections shall 
be that determined at a distance 2t or 150 mm, 
whichever is less, from the point of minimum 
thickness, where t is the minimum thickness. 
722.2.1.1.4  
Ribbed or undulating surfaces.  
The equivalent thickness of panels with ribbed or 
undulating surfaces shall be determined by one of 
the following expressions:  
For s ≥ 4t, the thickness to be used shall be t  
For s ≤ 2t, the thickness to be used shall be te  
For 4t > s > 2t, the thickness to be used shall be  
𝑡+ (4𝑡
𝑠−1) (𝑡𝑒+ 𝑡) 
(7-3) 
where: 
s = Spacing of ribs or undulations. 
t = Minimum thickness. 
te = Equivalent 
thickness 
of 
the 
panel 
calculated as the net cross-sectional area of
the panel divided by the width, in which 
the maximum thickness used in the 
calculation shall not exceed 2t . 
722.2.1.2  
Multiwythe walls. For walls that 
consist of two wythes of different types of concrete, 
the fire-resistance ratings shall be permitted to be 
determined from Figure 722.2.1.2. 
722.2.1.2.1  
Two or more wythes. The fire-
resistance rating for wall panels consisting of two 
or more wythes shall be permitted to be determined 
by the formula: 
R =(R1
0.59 + R2
0.59 +...+ Rn
0.59)
1.7 
(7-4) 
where: 
R 
= The fire endurance of the assembly, 
minutes. 
R1, R2, 
and Rn 
= The fire endurances of the individual 
wythes, minutes. Values of Rn0.59 for
use in Equation 7-4 are given in 
Table 722.2.1.2(1). Calculated fire-
resistance ratings are shown in 
Table 722.2.1.2(2). 
722.2.1.2.2  
Foam plastic insulation. The fire-
resistance ratings of precast concrete wall panels 
consisting of a layer of foam plastic insulation 
sandwiched between two wythes of concrete shall 
be permitted to be determined by use of Equation 7-
4. Foam plastic insulation with a total thickness of 
less than 25 mm shall be disregarded. The Rn value 
for thickness of foam plastic insulation of 25 mm or 
greater, for use in the calculation, is 5 minutes; 
therefore Rn0.59 = 2.5. 
722.2.1.3  
Joints between precast wall 
panels. Joints between precast concrete wall panels 
that are not insulated as required by this section 
shall be considered as openings in walls. 
Uninsulated joints shall be included in determining 
the percentage of openings permitted by Table 
705.8. Where openings are not permitted or are 
required by this code to be protected, the provisions 
of this section shall be used to determine the amount 
of joint insulation required. Insulated joints shall 
not be considered openings for purposes of 
determining compliance with the allowable 
percentage of openings in Table 705.8. 
722.2.1.3.1  
Ceramic fiber joint protection. 
Figure 722.2.1.3.1 shows thicknesses of ceramic 
fiber blankets to be used to insulate joints between 
precast concrete wall panels for various panel 
thicknesses and for joint widths of 10 mm and 25 
mm for fire-resistance ratings of 1 hour to 4 hours. 
For joint widths between 10 mm and 25 mm, the 
thickness of ceramic fiber blanket is allowed to be 
determined by direct interpolation. Other tested and 
labeled materials are acceptable in place of ceramic 
fiber blankets. 
722.2.1.4  
Walls with gypsum wallboard or 
plaster finishes. The fire-resistance rating of cast-
in-place or precast concrete walls with finishes of 
gypsum wallboard or plaster applied to one or both

sides shall be permitted to be calculated in 
accordance with the provisions of this section. 
722.2.1.4.1  
Nonfire-exposed side. Where the 
finish of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to 
the side of the wall not exposed to fire, the 
contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance 
rating shall be determined as follows: The thickness 
of the finish shall first be corrected by multiplying 
the actual thickness of the finish by the applicable 
factor determined from Table 722.2.1.4(1) based on 
the type of aggregate in the concrete. The corrected 
thickness of finish shall then be added to the actual 
or equivalent thickness of concrete and fire-
resistance rating of the concrete and finish 
determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) 
and Figure 722.2.1.2. 
722.2.1.4.2  
Fire-exposed side. Where gypsum 
wallboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed 
side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the 
total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as 
follows: The time assigned to the finish as 
established by Table 722.2.1.4(2) shall be added to 
the fire-resistance rating determined from Tables 
722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2 for 
the concrete alone, or to the rating determined in 
Section 722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on 
the nonfire-exposed side. 
722.2.1.4.3  
Nonsymmetrical assemblies. For 
a wall having no finish on one side or different types 
or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation 
procedures of Sections 722.2.1.4.1 and 722.2.1.4.2 
shall be performed twice, assuming either side of 
the wall to be the fire-exposed side. The fire-
resistance rating of the wall shall not exceed the 
lower of the two values. 
Exception: For an exterior wall with a fire 
separation distance greater than 1500 mm the fire 
shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only. 
722.2.1.4.4  
Minimum 
concrete 
fire-
resistance rating. Where finishes applied to one or 
both sides of a concrete wall contribute to the fire-
resistance rating, the concrete alone shall provide 
not less than one-half of the total required fire-
resistance rating. Additionally, the contribution to 
the fire resistance of the finish on the nonfire-
exposed side of a load-bearing wall shall not 
exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete 
alone. 
722.2.1.4.5

Hollow-core prestressed slabs.  
For hollow-core prestressed concrete slabs in which 
the cores are of constant cross section throughout 
the length, the equivalent thickness shall be 
permitted to be obtained by dividing the net cross-
sectional area of the slab including grout in the 
joints, by its width. 
722.2.2.1.2  
Slabs with sloping soffits. The 
thickness of slabs with sloping soffits (see Figure 
722.2.2.1.2) shall be determined at a distance 2t or 
150 mm, whichever is less, from the point of 
minimum thickness, where t is the minimum 
thickness. 
 
722.2.2.1.3  
Slabs with ribbed soffits. The 
thickness of slabs with ribbed or undulating soffits 
(see Figure 722.2.2.1.3) shall be determined by one 
of the following expressions, whichever is 
applicable: 
For s > 4t, the thickness to be used shall be t  
For s ≤ 2t, the thickness to be used shall be te  
For 4t > s > 2t, the thickness to be used shall be 
𝑡+ (4𝑡
𝑠−1) (𝑡𝑒+ 𝑡) 
(7-5) 
where: 
s = Spacing of ribs or undulations. 
t = Minimum thickness.

722.2.2.3(2). 
722.2.2.3.1  
Heat transfer. For the transfer of 
heat, three-ply built-up roofing contributes 10 
minutes to the fire-resistance rating. The fire-
resistance rating for concrete assemblies such as 
those shown in Figure 722.2.2.3(1) shall be 
increased by 10 minutes. This increase is not 
applicable to those shown in Figure 722.2.2.3(2).  
722.2.2.4  
Joints in precast slabs. Joints 
between adjacent precast concrete slabs need not be 
considered in calculating the slab thickness 
provided that a concrete topping not less than 25 
mm thick is used. Where no concrete topping is 
used, joints must be grouted to a depth of not less 
than one-third the slab thickness at the joint, but not 
less than 25 mm, or the joints must be made fire 
resistant by other approved methods.

cover. 
The 
minimum 
thickness of concrete cover to the positive moment 
reinforcement shall comply with Table 722.2.3(1) 
for reinforced concrete and Table 722.2.3(2) for 
prestressed concrete. These tables are applicable for 
solid or hollow-core one-way or two-way slabs with 
flat undersurfaces. These tables are applicable to 
slabs that are either cast in place or precast. For

of the tendon and the fire-exposed surface of the 
beam, except that for ungrouted ducts, the assumed 
cover thickness is the minimum thickness of 
concrete between the surface of the duct and the 
fire-exposed surface of the beam. For beams in 
which two or more tendons are used, the cover is 
assumed to be the average of the minimum cover of 
the individual tendons. For corner tendons (tendons 
equal distance from the bottom and side), the 
minimum cover used in the calculation shall be one-
half the actual value. For stemmed members with 
two or more prestressing tendons located along the 
vertical centerline of the stem, the average cover 
shall be the distance from the bottom of the member 
to the centroid of the tendons. The actual cover for 
any individual tendon shall be not less than one-half

having a depth of 13 mm or more 
between wythes. 
722.3.4  Concrete masonry lintels. Fire-resistance 
ratings for concrete masonry lintels shall be 
determined based upon the nominal thickness of the 
lintel and the minimum thickness of concrete 
masonry or concrete, or any combination thereof,

(7-9) 
where:  
R  = The fire-resistance rating of the 
assembly (hours). 
Rn = The fire-resistance rating of the 
individual wall (hours). 
pl  = Coefficient for thickness of plaster. 
Values for Rn0.59 for use in Equation 7-9 are given 
in Table 722.4.1(3). Coefficients for thickness of 
plaster shall be selected from Table 722.4.1(4) 
based on the actual thickness of plaster applied to 
the wall or partition and whether one or two sides 
of the wall are plastered.  
722.4.1.3  
Multiwythe walls with airspace.  
Where a continuous airspace separates multiple 
wythes of the wall or partition, the total fire-

resistance ratings of structural steel columns shall 
be based on the size of the element and the type of 
protection provided in accordance with this section. 
722.5.1.1  
General. 
These 
procedures 
establish a basis for determining the fire resistance 
of column assemblies as a function of the thickness 
of fire-resistant material and, the weight, W, and 
heated perimeter, D, of structural steel columns. As 
used in these sections, W is the average weight of a 
structural steel column in kilogram per linear meter 
. The heated perimeter, D, is the inside perimeter of 
the fire-resistant material in millimeters as 
illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(1).  
722.5.1.1.1  
Nonload-bearing protection. The 
application of these procedures shall be limited to 
column assemblies in which the fire-resistant 
material is not designed to carry any of the load 
acting on the column. 
722.5.1.1.2  
Embedments. In the absence of 
substantiating fire-endurance test results, ducts, 
conduit, piping, and similar mechanical, electrical, 
and plumbing installations shall not be embedded in 
any required fire-resistant materials.

722.5.1(1) contains weight-to-heated-perimeter 
ratios (W/D) for both contour and box fire-resistant 
profiles, for the wide flange shapes most often used 
as columns. For different fire-resistant protection 
profiles 
or 
column 
cross 
sections, 
the                 
weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) shall be 
determined in accordance with the definitions given 
in this section. 
722.5.1.2  
Gypsum wallboard protection. 
The fire resistance of structural steel columns with 
weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) less than 
or equal to 3.65 and that are protected with Type X 
gypsum wallboard shall be permitted to be 
determined from the following expression: 
𝑅= 130 [

0.75
 
(7-12) 
where: 
R = Fire resistance (minutes).

Attachment. The gypsum board or 
gypsum panel products shall be supported as 
illustrated in either Figure 722.5.1(2) for fire-
resistance ratings of 4 hours or less, or                    
Figure 722.5.1(3) for fire-resistance ratings of 3 
hours or less. 
722.5.1.2.2  
Gypsum wallboard equivalent to 
concrete. The determination of the fire resistance 
of structural steel columns from Figure 722.5.1(4) 
is permitted for various thicknesses of gypsum 
wallboard as a function of the weight-to-heated 
perimeter ratio (W/D) of the column. For structural 
steel columns with weight-to-heated-perimeter 
ratios (W/D) greater than 3.65, the thickness of

Sprayed fire-resistant materials. 
The fire resistance of wide-flange structural steel 
columns protected with sprayed fire-resistant 
materials, as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(5), shall

be determined for specific fire-resistant materials 
on the basis of standard fire endurance tests in 
accordance with Section 703.2. Unless evidence is 
submitted to the building official substantiating a 
broader application, this expression shall be limited 
to determining the fire resistance of structural steel 
columns with weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios 
(W/D) between the largest and smallest columns for 
which standard fire-resistance test results are 
available. 
722.5.1.3.2

girders shall be based upon the size of the element 
and the type of protection provided in accordance 
with this section. 
722.5.2.1  
Determination of fire resistance. 
These procedures establish a basis for determining

calculated for the substitute beam or girder 
(T1) shall be not less than 10 mm. 
3.  The unrestrained or restrained beam rating 
shall be not less than 1 hour.

722.6.1  General. This section contains procedures 
for calculating the fire-resistance ratings of walls, 
floor/ceiling and roof/ceiling assemblies based in 
part on the standard method of testing referenced in 
Section 703.2. 
722.6.1.1

apply to both load-bearing and nonload-bearing 
assemblies. 
722.6.2.1  
Fire-resistance rating of wood 
frame assemblies. The fire-resistance rating of a 
wood frame assembly is equal to the sum of the time 
assigned to the membrane on the fire-exposed side, 
the time assigned to the framing members and the 
time assigned for additional contribution by other 
protective measures such as insulation. The 
membrane on the unexposed side shall not be 
included in determining the fire resistance of the 
assembly. 
722.6.2.2

Table 722.6.2(1) indicates the time assigned to 
membranes on the fire-exposed side. 
722.6.2.3  
Exterior walls. For an exterior 
wall with a fire separation distance greater than 
3000 mm , the wall is assigned a rating dependent 
on the interior membrane and the framing as 
described in Tables 722.6.2(1) and 722.6.2(2). The 
membrane on the outside of the nonfire-exposed 
side of exterior walls with a fire separation distance 
greater than 3000 mm shall consist of sheathing, 
sheathing paper and siding as described in Table 
722.6.2(3). 
722.6.2.4

Two layers of 16 mm Type X gypsum wallboardc are 
attached to Ushaped brackets spaced 600 mm on center. 
0.45 mm thick (No. 25 carbon sheet steel gage) 40 mm 
deep by 25 mm galvanized steel runner channels are first 
installed parallel to and on each side of the top beam 
flange to provide a 13 mm clearance to the flange. The 
channel runners are attached to steel deck or concrete 
floor construction with approved fasteners spaced 300 
mm on center. Ushaped brackets are formed from 
members identical to the channel runners. At the bent 
portion of the U-shaped bracket, the flanges of the 
channel are cut out so that 40 mm deep corner channels 
can be inserted without attachment parallel to each side 
of the lower flange. As an alternate, 500 mm thick (No. 
24 carbon sheet steel gage) 25 mm × 50 mm runner and 
corner angles may be used in lieu of channels, and the 
web cutouts in the U-shaped brackets may be omitted.

applicable requirements of Section 909 and the 
generally accepted and well-established principles 
of engineering relevant to the design. The 
construction documents shall include sufficient 
information and detail to adequately describe the 
elements of the design necessary for the proper 
implementation of the smoke control systems. 
These documents shall be accompanied by 
sufficient information and analysis to demonstrate 
compliance with these provisions. 
 
909.3  Special inspection and test requirements. 
In addition to the ordinary inspection and test 
requirements that buildings, structures and parts 
thereof are required to undergo, smoke control 
systems subject to the provisions of Section 909 
shall undergo special inspections and tests 
sufficient to verify the proper commissioning of the 
smoke control design in its final installed condition. 
The 
design 
submission 
accompanying 
the

detail 
procedures and methods to be used and the items 
subject to such inspections and tests. Such 
commissioning shall be in accordance with 
generally accepted engineering practice and, where 
possible, based on published standards for the 
particular testing involved. The special inspections 
and tests required by this section shall be conducted 
under the same terms in Section 1704. 
 
909.4  Analysis. A rational analysis supporting 
the types of smoke control systems to be employed, 
their methods of operation, the systems supporting 
them and the methods of construction to be utilized 
shall accompany the submitted construction 
documents and shall include, but not be limited to, 
the items indicated in Sections 909.4.1 through 
909.4.7. 
 
909.4.1  Stack effect. The system shall be designed 
such that the maximum probable normal or reverse 
stack effect will not adversely interfere with the 
system’s capabilities. In determining the maximum 
probable stack effect, altitude, elevation, weather 
history and interior temperatures shall be used. 
 
909.4.2  Temperature effect of fire. Buoyancy and 
expansion caused by the design fire in accordance 
with Section 909.9 shall be analyzed. The system 
shall be designed such that these effects do not 
adversely interfere with the system’s capabilities. 
 
 
909.4.3  Wind effect. The design shall consider the 
adverse effects of wind. Such consideration shall be 
consistent with the wind-loading provisions of 
Chapter 16. 
 
909.4.4  HVAC systems. The design shall consider 
the effects of the heating, ventilating and air-
conditioning (HVAC) systems on both smoke and 
fire transport. The analysis shall include all 
permutations of systems status. The design shall 
consider the effects of the fire on the HVAC 
systems. 
 
909.4.5  Climate. The design shall consider the 
effects of low temperatures on systems, property 
and occupants. Air inlets and exhausts shall be 
located so as to prevent snow or ice blockage.

SECTION 1004  OCCUPANT LOAD 
1004.1  Design occupant load. In determining 
means of egress requirements, the number of 
occupants for whom means of egress facilities are 
provided shall be determined in accordance with 
this section. 
1004.1.1  
Cumulative 
occupant 
loads. 
Where the path of egress travel includes intervening 
rooms, areas or spaces, cumulative occupant loads 
shall be determined in accordance with this section. 
1004.1.1.1  
Intervening spaces or accessory 
areas. Where occupants egress from one or more 
rooms, areas or spaces through others, the design 
occupant load shall be the combined occupant load 
of interconnected accessory or intervening spaces. 
Design of egress path capacity shall be based on the 
cumulative portion of occupant loads of all rooms, 
areas or spaces to that point along the path of egress 
travel. 
1004.1.1.2  
Adjacent levels for mezzanines. 
That portion of the occupant load of a mezzanine 
with required egress through a room, area or space 
on an adjacent level shall be added to the occupant 
load of that room, area or space. 
1004.1.1.3  
Adjacent stories. Other than for 
the egress components designed for convergence in 
accordance with Section 1005.6, the occupant load 
from separate stories shall not be added. 
1004.1.2  
Areas without fixed seating. The 
number of occupants shall be computed at the rate 
of one occupant per unit of area as prescribed in 
Table 1004.1.2. For areas without fixed seating, the 
occupant load shall be not less than that number 
determined by dividing the floor area under 
consideration by the occupant load factor assigned 
to the function of the space as set forth in Table 
1004.1.2. Where an intended function is not listed 
in Table 1004.1.2, the building official shall 
establish a function based on a listed function that 
most nearly resembles the intended function. 
Exception: Where approved by the building 
official, the actual number of occupants for whom 
each occupied space, floor or building is designed, 
although less than those determined by calculation, 
shall be permitted to be used in the determination of 
the design occupant load. 
 
1004.2  Increased occupant load. The occupant 
load permitted in any building, or portion thereof, 
is permitted to be increased from that number 
established for the occupancies in Table 1004.1.2, 
provided that all other requirements of the code are 
met based on such modified number and the 
occupant load does not exceed one occupant per 
0.65 m2 of occupiable floor space. Where required 
by the building official, an approved aisle, seating 
or fixed equipment diagram substantiating any 
increase in occupant load shall be submitted. Where 
required by the building official, such diagram shall 
be posted. 
1004.3  Posting of occupant load. Every room or 
space that is an assembly occupancy shall have the 
occupant load of the room or space posted in a 
conspicuous place, near the main exit or exit access 
doorway from the room or space. Posted signs shall

# Page 401

CHAPTER 10  -MEANS OF EGRESS 
 
SBC 201-CR-18 
375 
 
be of an approved legible permanent design and 
shall be maintained by the owner or the owner’s 
authorized agent. 
 
1004.4  Fixed seating. For areas having fixed seats 
and aisles, the occupant load shall be determined by 
the number of fixed seats installed therein. The 
occupant load for areas in which fixed seating is not 
installed, such as waiting spaces, shall be 
determined in accordance with Section 1004.1.2 
and added to the number of fixed seats. The 
occupant load of wheelchair spaces and the 
associated companion seat shall be based on one 
occupant for each wheelchair space and one 
occupant for the associated companion seat 
provided in accordance with Section 1108.2.3. For 
areas having fixed seating without dividing arms, 
the occupant load shall be not less than the number 
of seats based on one person for each 450 mm of 
seating length.  
The occupant load of seating booths shall be based 
on one person for each 600 mm of booth seat length 
measured at the backrest of the seating booth. 
1004.5  Outdoor areas. Yards, patios, courts and 
similar outdoor areas accessible to and usable by the 
building occupants shall be provided with means of 
egress as required by this chapter. The occupant 
load of such outdoor areas shall be assigned by the 
building official in accordance with the anticipated 
use. Where outdoor areas are to be used by persons 
in addition to the occupants of the building, and the 
path of egress travel from the outdoor areas passes 
through the building, means of egress requirements 
for the building shall be based on the sum of the 
occupant loads of the building plus the outdoor 
areas. 
Exceptions: 
1. Outdoor areas used exclusively for service of 
the building need only have one means of 
egress. 
2. Both outdoor areas associated with Group R-
3 and individual dwelling units of Group R-
2. 
1004.6  Multiple occupancies. Where a building 
contains two or more occupancies, the means of 
egress requirements shall apply to each portion of 
the building based on the occupancy of that space. 
Where two or more occupancies utilize portions of 
the same means of egress system, those egress 
components shall meet the more stringent 
requirements of all occupancies that are served. 
 
 
SECTION 1005  MEANS OF EGRESS 
SIZING 
1005.1  General. All portions of the means of 
egress system shall be sized in accordance with this 
section. 
Exception: Aisles and aisle accessways in rooms or 
spaces used for assembly purposes complying with 
Section 1029. 
1005.2  Minimum width based on component. 
The minimum width, in millimeters, of any means 
of egress components shall be not less than that 
specified for such component, elsewhere in this 
code. 
1005.3  Required capacity based on occupant 
load. The required capacity, in millimeters, of the 
means of egress for any room, area, space or story 
shall be not less than that determined in accordance 
with Sections 1005.3.1 and 1005.3.2.  
1005.3.1  
Stairways. 
The 
capacity, 
in 
millimeters, of means of egress stairways shall be 
calculated by multiplying the occupant load served 
by such stairways by a means of egress capacity 
factor of 7.6 mm per occupant. Where stairways 
serve more than one story, only the occupant load 
of each story considered individually shall be used 
in calculating the required capacity of the stairways 
serving that story.  
Exceptions:  
1. For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, 
the capacity, in millimeters, of means of 
egress stairways shall be calculated by 
multiplying the occupant load served by such 
stairways by a means of egress capacity 
factor of 5.08 mm per occupant in buildings 
equipped throughout with an automatic 
sprinkler system installed in accordance with 
Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 and an 
emergency voice/ alarm communication 
system in accordance with Section 907.5.2.2.  
2. Facilities with smoke-protected assembly 
seating shall be permitted to use the capacity 
factors in Table 1029.6.2 indicated for

3. Facilities with outdoor smoke-protected 
assembly seating shall be permitted to the 
capacity factors in Section 1029.6.3 indicated 
for stepped aisles for exit access or exit 
stairways where the entire path for means of 
egress from the seating to the exit discharge 
is open to the outdoors.  
1005.3.2  
Other egress components. The 
capacity, in millimeters, of means of egress 
components other than stairways shall be calculated 
by multiplying the occupant load served by such 
component by a means of egress capacity factor of 
5.08 mm per occupant.  
Exceptions:  
1. For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, 
the capacity, in millimeters, of means of 
egress components other than stairways shall 
be calculated by multiplying the occupant 
load served by such component by a means 
of egress capacity factor of 3.8 mm per 
occupant in buildings equipped throughout 
with an automatic sprinkler system installed 
in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 
903.3.1.2 and an emergency voice/alarm 
communication system in accordance with 
Section 907.5.2.2. 
2. Facilities with smoke-protected assembly 
seating shall be permitted to use the capacity 
factors in Table 1029.6.2 indicated for level 
or ramped aisles for means of egress 
components other than stairways where the 
entire path for means of egress from the 
seating to the exit discharge is provided with 
a smoke control system complying with 
Section 909.  
3. Facilities with outdoor smoke-protected 
assembly seating shall be permitted to the 
capacity factors in Section 1029.6.3 indicated 
for level or ramped aisles for means of egress 
components other than stairways where the 
entire path for means of egress from the 
seating to the exit discharge is open to the 
outdoors.  
1005.4  Continuity. The minimum width or 
required capacity of the means of egress required 
from any story of a building shall not be reduced 
along the path of egress travel until arrival at the 
public way.  
1005.5  Distribution of minimum width and 
required capacity. Where more than one exit, or 
access to more than one exit, is required, the means 
of egress shall be configured such that the loss of 
any one exit, or access to one exit, shall not reduce 
the available capacity or width to less than 50 
percent of the required capacity or width.  
1005.6  Egress convergence. Where the means of 
egress from stories above and below converge at an 
intermediate level, the capacity of the means of 
egress from the point of convergence shall be not 
less than the largest minimum width or the sum of 
the required capacities for the stairways or ramps 
serving the two adjacent stories, whichever is 
larger.  
1005.7  Encroachment. Encroachments into the 
required means of egress width shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of this section.

required to meet the minimum design slope 
requirement of one-quarter unit vertical in 12 
units horizontal (2-percent slope) in Section 
1507 for roofs that provide positive roof 
drainage. 
2. Recovering or replacing an existing roof 
covering shall not be required to meet the 
requirement for secondary (emergency 
overflow) drains or scuppers in Section 
1503.4 for roofs that provide for positive roof 
drainage. For the purposes of this exception, 
existing secondary drainage or scupper 
systems required in accordance with this 
code shall not be removed unless they are 
replaced by secondary drains or scuppers 
designed and installed in accordance with 
Section 1503.4. 
1511.2  Structural 
and 
construction 
loads.  
Structural roof components shall be capable of 
supporting the roof-covering system and the 
material and equipment loads that will be 
encountered during installation of the system. 
1511.3  Roof replacement.  Roof replacement shall 
include the removal of all existing layers of roof 
coverings down to the roof deck. 
Exception: Not applicable in the Kingdom. 
1511.3.1  
Roof recover. The installation of a 
new roof covering over an existing roof covering 
shall be permitted where any of the following 
conditions occur: 
1. Where the new roof covering is installed in 
accordance 
with 
the 
roof 
covering 
manufacturer’s approved instructions. 
2. Complete and separate roofing systems, such 
as standing-seam metal roof panel systems, 
that are designed to transmit the roof loads 
directly to the building’s structural system 
and that do not rely on existing roofs and roof 
coverings for support, shall not require the 
removal of existing roof coverings. 
3. Metal panel, metal shingle and concrete and 
clay tile roof coverings shall be permitted to 
be installed over existing wood shake roofs 
when applied in accordance with Section 
1511.4. 
4. The application of a new protective coating 
over an existing spray polyurethane foam 
roofing system shall be permitted without 
tear off of existing roof coverings. 
1511.3.1.1  
Exceptions.  A roof recover shall 
not be permitted where any of the following 
conditions occur: 
1. Where the existing roof or roof covering is 
water soaked or has deteriorated to the point 
that the existing roof or roof covering is not 
adequate as a base for additional roofing. 
2. Where the existing roof covering is slate, clay, 
cement or asbestos-cement tile. 
3. Where the existing roof has two or more 
applications of any type of roof covering. 
1511.4  Roof recovering.  Where the application of 
a new roof covering over wood shingle or shake 
roofs creates a combustible concealed space, the 
entire existing surface shall be covered with 
gypsum board, mineral fiber, glass fiber or other 
approved materials securely fastened in place. 
1511.5  Reinstallation of materials.  Existing 
slate, clay or cement tile shall be permitted for 
reinstallation, except that damaged, cracked or 
broken slate or tile shall not be reinstalled. Existing

SECTION 1604  GENERAL DESIGN 
REQUIREMENTS 
1604.1  General. Building, structures and parts 
thereof shall be designed and constructed in 
accordance with strength design, load and 
resistance factor design, allowable stress design, 
empirical design or conventional construction 
methods, as permitted by the applicable material 
chapters. 
1604.2  Strength. Buildings and other structures, 
and parts thereof, shall be designed and constructed 
to support safely the factored loads in load 
combinations defined in this code without 
exceeding the appropriate strength limit states for 
the materials of construction. Alternatively, 
buildings and other structures, and parts thereof, 
shall be designed and constructed to support safely 
the nominal loads in load combinations defined in 
this code without exceeding the appropriate 
specified allowable stresses for the materials of 
construction. 
Loads and forces for occupancies or uses not 
covered in this chapter shall be subject to the 
approval of the building official. 
1604.3  Serviceability. Structural systems and 
members thereof shall be designed to have adequate

# Page 537

CHAPTER 16  -STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
 
SBC 201-CR-18 
511 
 
stiffness to limit deflections, lateral drift, vibration, 
or any other deformations that adversely affect the 
intended use and performance of buildings and 
other structures. See Section 12.12.1 of SBC 301 
for drift limits applicable to earthquake loading. 
1604.3.1  
Deflections. The deflections of 
structural members shall not exceed the more 
restrictive of the limitations of Sections 1604.3.2 
through 1604.3.5 or that permitted by Table 1604.3. 
1604.3.2  
Reinforced 
concrete. 
The 
deflection 
of 
reinforced 
concrete 
structural 
members shall not exceed that permitted by SBC 
304. 
1604.3.3  
Steel. The deflection of steel 
structural members shall not exceed that permitted 
by AISC 360, AISI S100, ASCE 8, SJI CJ, SJI JG, 
SJI K or SJI LH/DLH, as applicable. 
1604.3.4  
Masonry. 
The 
deflection 
of 
masonry structural members shall not exceed that 
permitted by SBC 305. 
1604.3.5  
Aluminum. The deflection of 
aluminum structural members shall not exceed that 
permitted by AA ADM1. 
1604.3.6  
Limits. The deflection limits of 
Section 1604.3.1 shall be used unless more 
restrictive deflection limits are required by a 
referenced standard for the element or finish 
material. 
1604.4  Analysis. Load effects on structural 
members and their connections shall be determined 
by methods of structural analysis that take into 
account equilibrium, general stability, geometric 
compatibility and both short- and long-term 
material properties.  
Members that tend to accumulate residual 
deformations under repeated service loads shall 
have included in their analysis the added 
eccentricities expected to occur during their service 
life.  
Any system or method of construction to be used 
shall be based on a rational analysis in accordance 
with well-established principles of mechanics. Such 
analysis shall result in a system that provides a 
complete load path capable of transferring loads 
from their point of origin to the load-resisting 
elements.  
The total lateral force shall be distributed to the 
various vertical elements of the lateral force-
resisting system in proportion to their rigidities, 
considering the rigidity of the horizontal bracing 
system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed not 
to be a part of the lateral force-resisting system are 
permitted to be incorporated into buildings 
provided their effect on the action of the system is 
considered and provided for in the design. A 
diaphragm is rigid for the purpose of distribution of 
story shear and torsional moment when the lateral 
deformation of the diaphragm is less than or equal 
to two times the average story drift. Where required 
by SBC 301, provisions shall be made for the 
increased forces induced on resisting elements of 
the structural system resulting from torsion due to 
eccentricity between the center of application of the 
lateral forces and the center of rigidity of the lateral 
force-resisting system.  
Every structure shall be designed to resist the 
overturning effects caused by the lateral forces 
specified in this chapter. See Section 1609 for wind 
loads, Section 1610 for lateral soil loads and 
Section 1613 for earthquake loads. 
1604.5  Risk category. Each building and structure 
shall be assigned a risk category in accordance with 
Table 1604.5. Where a referenced standard 
specifies an occupancy category, the risk category 
shall not be taken as lower than the occupancy 
category specified therein.   
1604.5.1  
Multiple occupancies. Where a 
building or structure is occupied by two or more 
occupancies not included in the same risk category, 
it shall be assigned the classification of the highest 
risk category corresponding to the various 
occupancies. Where buildings or structures have 
two or more portions that are structurally separated, 
each portion shall be separately classified. Where a 
separated portion of a building or structure provides 
required access to, required egress from or shares 
life safety components with another portion having 
a higher risk category, both portions shall be 
assigned to the higher risk category. 
1604.6  In-situ load tests. The building official is 
authorized to require an engineering analysis or a 
load test, or both, of any construction whenever 
there is reason to question the safety of the 
construction 
for 
the 
intended 
occupancy. 
Engineering analysis and load tests shall be 
conducted in accordance with Section 1708. 
1604.7  Preconstruction load tests. Materials and 
methods of construction that are not capable of 
being designed by approved engineering analysis or 
that do not comply with the applicable referenced 
standards, or alternative test procedures in

# Page 538

accordance with Section 1707, shall be load tested 
in accordance with Section 1709. 
1604.8  Anchorage. Buildings and other structures, 
and portions thereof, shall be provided with 
anchorage in accordance with Sections 1604.8.1 
through 1604.8.3, as applicable. 
1604.8.1  
General. Anchorage of the roof to 
walls and columns, and of walls and columns to 
foundations, shall be provided to resist the uplift 
and sliding forces that result from the application of 
the prescribed loads. 
1604.8.2  
Structural 
walls. 
Walls 
that 
provide vertical load-bearing resistance or lateral 
shear resistance for a portion of the structure shall 
be anchored to the roof and to all floors and 
members that provide lateral support for the wall or 
that are supported by the wall. The connections 
shall be capable of resisting the horizontal forces 
specified in Section 1.5.11 of SBC 301 for walls of 
structures assigned to Seismic Design Category A 
and to Section 12.11 of SBC 301 for walls of 
structures assigned to all other seismic design 
categories. Required anchors in masonry walls of 
hollow units or cavity walls shall be embedded in a 
reinforced grouted structural element of the wall. 
See Sections 1609 for wind design requirements 
and 1613 for earthquake design requirements. 
1604.8.3  
Decks. 
Where 
supported 
by 
attachment to an exterior wall, decks shall be 
positively anchored to the primary structure and 
designed for both vertical and lateral loads as 
applicable. 
Such 
attachment 
shall 
not 
be 
accomplished by the use of toenails or nails subject 
to withdrawal. Where positive connection to the 
primary building structure cannot be   verified 
during inspection, decks shall be self-supporting. 
Connections of decks with cantilevered framing 
members to exterior walls or other framing 
members shall be designed for both of the 
following: 
1. The reactions resulting from the dead load and 
live load specified in Table 1607.1, in 
accordance with Section 1605, acting on all 
portions of the deck. 
2. The reactions resulting from the dead load and 
live load specified in Table 1607.1, in 
accordance with Section 1605, acting on the 
cantilevered portion of the deck, and no live 
load on the remaining portion of the deck. 
1604.9  Counteracting structural actions. All 
structural members, systems, components and 
cladding in a building or other structure, shall be 
designed to resist forces due to earthquakes, wind, 
soil and hydrostatic pressure and flood loads with 
consideration of overturning, sliding and uplift. 
Continuous load paths shall be provided for 
transmitting these forces to the foundation. Where 
sliding is used to isolate the elements, the effects of 
friction between sliding elements shall be included 
as a force. Where all or a portion of the resistance 
to these forces is provided by dead load, the dead 
load shall be taken as the minimum dead load likely 
to be in place during the event causing the 
considered forces. Consideration shall be given to 
the effects of vertical and horizontal deflections 
resulting from such forces. 
1604.10  
Wind and seismic detailing. 
Lateral force-resisting systems shall meet seismic 
detailing requirements and limitations prescribed in 
this code and SBC 301, excluding Chapter 14 and 
Appendix A, even when wind load effects are 
greater than seismic load effects. 
SECTION 1605  LOAD COMBINATIONS 
1605.1  General. Buildings and other structures 
and portions thereof shall be designed to resist:

Section 12.2.5.2, 12.3.3.3 or 12.10.2.1 of 
SBC 301. With the simplified procedure of 
SBC 301 Section 12.14, the seismic load 
effects including overstrength factor in 
accordance with Section 12.14.3.5 of SBC 
301 shall be used. 
Applicable loads shall be considered, including 
both earthquake and wind, in accordance with the 
specified 
load 
combinations. 
Each 
load 
combination shall also be investigated with one or 
more of the variable loads set to zero. 
Where the load combinations with overstrength 
factor in Section 12.4.3.2 of SBC 301 apply, they 
shall be used as follows: 
1. The basic combinations for strength design 
with over-strength factor in lieu of Equations 
16-11 and 16-13 in Section 1605.2. 
2. The basic combinations for allowable stress 
design with overstrength factor in lieu of

verified, use of the load combinations specified in 
Section 1605.2 or 1605.3 shall be permitted. Where 
the load combinations specified in Section 1605.2 
are used, strength reduction factors applicable to 
soil resistance shall be provided by a registered 
design professional. The stability of retaining walls 
shall be verified in accordance with Section 7.4 of 
SBC 303. 
1605.2  Load 
combinations 
using 
strength 
design or load and resistance factor design.

design is used, buildings and other structures, and 
portions thereof, shall be designed to resist the most 
critical effects resulting from the following

specifically required by other provisions of 
this code, such combinations shall take 
precedence. 
2. In loads combination of Equation (16-2), the 
load factor on D+F and L may be reduced to 
1.2 (D+F) and 1.6L respectively, when 
special inspection professional is employed 
and approved by the authority having 
jurisdiction.

material chapter or the referenced standards shall 
not be used with the load combinations of Section 
1605.3.1, except that increases shall be permitted in 
accordance with Chapter 23. 
1605.3.1.2  
Other loads. Where flood loads, 
𝐹𝑎, are to be considered in design, the load 
combinations of Section 2.4.2 of SBC 301 shall be 
used. Where self-straining loads, 𝑇, are considered 
in design, their structural effects in combination 
with other loads shall be determined in accordance 
with  Section 2.4.4  of SBC 301. 
1605.3.2  
Alternative 
basic 
load 
combinations. 
In 
lieu of the 
basic load 
combinations specified in Section 1605.3.1, 
structures and portions thereof shall be permitted to 
be designed for the most critical effects resulting 
from the following combinations. When using these 
alternative basic load combinations that include 
wind or seismic loads, allowable stresses are 
permitted to be increased or load combinations 
reduced where permitted by the material chapter of 
this code or the referenced standards. For load 
combinations that include the counteracting effects 
of dead and wind loads, only two-thirds of the 
minimum dead load likely to be in place during a 
design wind event shall be used. When using 
allowable stresses that have been increased or load 
combinations that have been reduced as permitted 
by the material chapter of this code or the 
referenced standards, where wind loads are 
calculated in accordance with Chapters 26 through 
31 of SBC 301, the coefficient (𝜔) in the following 
equations shall be taken as 1.3. For other wind 
loads, (𝜔) shall be taken as 1. When allowable 
stresses have not been increased or load 
combinations have not been reduced as permitted 
by the material chapter of this code or the 
referenced standards, (𝜔) shall be taken as 1. When 
using these alternative load combinations to 
evaluate sliding, overturning and soil bearing at the 
soil- structure interface, the reduction of foundation 
overturning from Section 12.13.4 in SBC 301 shall 
not be used. When using these alternative basic load 
combinations for proportioning foundations for 
loadings, which   include   seismic loads, the vertical 
seismic load effect, 𝐸𝑣, in Equation 12-4 of SBC 
301 is permitted to be taken equal to zero.

1605.3.2.1  
Other loads. Where 𝐹, 𝐻 or 𝑇 are 
to be considered in the design, each applicable load 
shall be added to the combinations specified in 
Section 1605.3.2. Where self- straining loads, 𝑇, are 
considered in design, their structural effects in 
combination with other loads shall be determined in 
accordance with Section 2.4.4 of SBC 301. 
SECTION 1606  DEAD LOADS 
1606.1  General. Dead loads are those loads 
defined in Chapter 2 of this code. Dead loads shall 
be considered permanent loads. 
1606.2  Design dead load. For purposes of design, 
the actual weights of materials of construction and 
fixed service equipment shall be used in accordance 
with Section 3.1 of SBC 301. In the absence of 
definite information, values used shall be subject to 
the approval of the building official. 
SECTION 1607  LIVE LOADS 
1607.1  General. Live loads are those loads defined 
in Chapter 2 of this code. 
1607.2  Loads not specified. For occupancies or 
uses not designated in this Chapter nor in Chapter 4 
of SBC 301, the live load shall be determined in 
accordance with a method approved by the building  
official. 
1607.3  Uniform live loads. The live loads used in 
the design of buildings and other structures shall be 
the maximum loads expected by the intended use or 
occupancy but shall in no case be less than the 
minimum uniformly distributed live loads given in 
Table 1607.1 or Section 4.3.1 of SBC 301. 
1607.4  Concentrated live loads. Floors and other 
similar surfaces shall be designed to support the 
uniformly distributed live loads prescribed in 
Section 1607.3 or the concentrated live loads, given 
in Table 1607.1, whichever produces the greater 
load effects. Unless otherwise specified, the 
indicated concentration shall be assumed to be 
uniformly distributed over an area of 750 mm by 
750 mm and shall be located so as to produce the 
maximum load effects in the structural members.

other buildings where partition locations are subject 
to change, provisions for partition weight shall be 
made, whether or not partitions are shown on the 
construction documents, unless the specified live 
load is 4 𝑘𝑁/𝑚2 or greater. The partition load shall

seismically 
isolated 
structures. Add the following exception to the end 
of Section 17.5.4.2 of SBC 301: 
Exception: For isolated structures designed in 
accordance with this standard, the structural system 
limitations including structural height limits, in 
Table 12.2-1 for ordinary steel concentrically 
braced frames (OCBFs) as defined in Chapter 11 
and ordinary moment frames (OMFs) as defined in 
Chapter 11 are permitted to be taken as 48 m for 
structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, 
E or F, provided that the following conditions are 
satisfied: 
1. The value of 𝑅1 as defined in Chapter 17 is 
taken as 1. 
2. For OMFs and OCBFs, design is in 
accordance with AISC 341. 
1613.5  Amendments to SBC 301. The provisions 
of Section 1613.5 shall be permitted as an 
amendment to the relevant provisions of SBC 301. 
1613.5.1  
Transfer of anchorage forces 
into diaphragm. Modify SBC 301 Section 
12.11.2.2.1 as follows: 
12.11.2.2.1 Transfer of anchorage forces into 
diaphragm. Diaphragms shall be provided with 
continuous ties or struts between diaphragm chords 
to distribute these anchorage forces into the 
diaphragms. Diaphragm connections shall be 
positive, mechanical or welded. Added chords are 
permitted to be used to form subdiaphragms to 
transmit the anchorage forces to the main 
continuous cross-ties. The maximum length-to-
width ratio of a wood, wood structural panel or 
untopped 
steel 
deck 
sheathed 
structural 
subdiaphragm that serves as part of the continuous 
tie system shall be 2.5 to 1. Connections and 
anchorages capable of resisting the prescribed 
forces shall be provided between the diaphragm and 
the attached components. Connections shall extend 
into the diaphragm a sufficient distance to develop 
the force transferred into the diaphragm. 
1613.6  Ballasted photovoltaic panel systems. 
Ballasted, 
roof-mounted 
photovoltaic 
panel 
systems need not be rigidly attached to the roof or 
supporting structure. Ballasted non- penetrating 
systems shall be designed and installed only on 
roofs with slopes not more than one unit vertical in 
12 units horizontal. Ballasted nonpenetrating 
systems shall be designed to resist sliding and uplift 
resulting from lateral and vertical forces as required 
by Section 1605, using a coefficient of friction 
determined by acceptable engineering principles. In 
structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C, 
D, E or F, ballasted nonpenetrating systems shall be 
designed to accommodate seismic displacement 
determined by nonlinear response-history analysis 
or shake-table testing, using input motions 
consistent with SBC 301 lateral and vertical seismic 
forces for nonstructural components on roofs.

slab reinforcement passing through the column. 
Exception: Where concrete slabs with continuous 
reinforcement having an area not less than 0.0015 
times the concrete area in each of two orthogonal 
directions are present and are either monolithic with 
or equivalently bonded to beams, girders or 
columns, 
the 
longitudinal 
reinforcing 
or 
prestressing steel passing through the column 
reinforcement shall have a nominal tensile strength 
of one-third of the required one-way vertical 
strength of the connection of the floor or roof

shear force and the axial tensile force need not be 
considered to act simultaneously. 
Exception: Where beams, girders, open web joist 
and joist girders support a concrete slab or concrete 
slab on metal deck that is attached to the beam or 
girder with not less than 10 mm-diameter  headed 
shear studs, at a spacing of not more than 300 mm 
on center, averaged over the length of the member, 
or other attachment having equivalent shear 
strength, and the slab contains continuous 
distributed reinforcement in each of two orthogonal 
directions with an area not less than 0.0015 times 
the concrete area, the nominal axial tension strength 
of the end connection shall be permitted to be taken 
as half the required vertical shear strength for ASD 
or one-third of the required shear strength for 
LRFD, but not less than 45 kN.

   𝑇𝑇 =  𝑤𝐿𝑆≤𝛼𝑇 𝑆 
(16-40) 
 
where: 
𝐿 = The span of the horizontal element in the 
direction of the tie, between bearing walls, m. 
𝑤 = The weight per unit area of the floor or roof in 
the span being tied to or across the wall, 𝑁/𝑚2. 
𝑆 = The spacing between ties, m. 
𝛼𝑇 = A coefficient with a value of 22 𝑘𝑁/𝑚 for

a. 
For structural roofing and siding made of formed metal sheets, the total load deflection shall not exceed L/60. 
For secondary roof structural members supporting formed metal roofing, the live load deflection shall not exceed L/150. 
For secondary wall members supporting formed metal siding, the design wind load deflection shall not exceed L/90. For 
roofs, this exception only applies when the metal sheets have no roof covering. 
b. 
Flexible, folding and portable partitions are not governed by the provisions of this section. The deflection 
criterion for interior partitions is based on the horizontal load defined in Section 1607.14. 
c. 
See Section 2403 for glass supports.  
d. 
The deflection limit for the D+L load combination only applies to the deflection due to the creep component of 
long-term dead load deflection plus the short- term live load deflection. For wood structural members that are dry at time 
of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-
term deflection shall be permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from 0.5D. For wood 
structural members at all other moisture conditions, the creep component of the long-term deflection is permitted to be 
estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from D. The value of 0.5D shall not be used in combination 
with ANSI/AWC NDS provisions for long-term loading.  
e. 
The above deflections do not ensure against ponding. Roofs that do not have sufficient slope or camber to 
ensure adequate drainage shall be investigated for ponding. See Section 1611 for rain and ponding requirements and 
Section 1503.4 for roof drainage requirements.  
f. 
The wind load is permitted to be taken as 0.42 times the “component and cladding” loads for the purpose of 
determining deflection limits herein. Where members support glass in accordance with Section 2403 using the deflection 
limit therein, the wind load shall be no less than 0.6 times the “component and cladding” loads for the purpose of 
determining deflection. 
g. 
For steel structural members, the dead load shall be taken as zero. 
h. 
For aluminum structural members or aluminum panels used in skylights and sloped glazing framing, roofs or 
walls of sunroom additions or patio covers not supporting edge of glass or aluminum sandwich panels, the total load 
deflection shall not exceed L/60. For continuous aluminum structural members supporting edge of glass, the total load 
deflection shall not exceed L/175 for each glass lite or L/60 for the entire length of the member, whichever is more 
stringent. For aluminum sandwich panels used in roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, the total load 
deflection shall not exceed L/120. 
i. 
For cantilever members, L shall be taken as twice the length of the cantilever.

i. Uninhabitable attics without storage are those where the maximum clear height between the joists and rafters is less than 1.1 m, 
or where there are not two or more adjacent trusses with web configurations capable of accommodating an assumed rectangle 1.1 
m in height by 600 mm in width, or greater, within the plane of the trusses. This live load need not be assumed to act concurrently 
with any other live load requirements. 
j. Uninhabitable attics with storage are those where the maximum clear height between the joists and rafters is 1.1 m or greater, or 
where there are two or more adjacent trusses with web configurations capable of accommodating an assumed rectangle 1.1 m in 
height by 600 mm in width, or greater, within the plane of the trusses.  
The live load need only be applied to those portions of the joists or truss bottom chords where both of the following 
conditions are met: 
a. The attic area is accessible from an opening not less than 500 mm in width by 750 mm in length that is located 
where the clear height in the attic is a minimum of 750 mm; and 
b. The slopes of the joists or truss bottom chords are no greater than two units vertical in 12 units horizontal (9.5% 
slope). 
The remaining portions of the joists or truss bottom chords shall be designed for a uniformly distributed non-concurrent 
live load of not less than 0.5 𝑘𝑁/𝑚2. 
k. Attic spaces served by stairways other than the pull-down type shall be designed to support the minimum live load specified for 
habitable attics and sleeping rooms. 
l. Areas of occupiable roofs, other than roof gardens and assembly areas, shall be designed for appropriate loads as approved by 
the building official. Unoccupied landscaped areas of roofs shall be designed in accordance with Section 1607.12.3. 
m. Live load reduction is not permitted unless specific exceptions of Section 1607.10 apply.

a. For framing of other species: (1) Find specific gravity for species of lumber in ANSI/AWC NDS. (2) For 
staples find shear value from table above for Structural I panels (regardless of actual grade) and multiply value 
by 0.82 for species with specific gravity of 0.42 or greater, or 0.65 for all other species. 
b. Panel edges backed with 50 mm nominal or wider framing. Install panels either horizontally or vertically. Space 
fasteners maximum 150 mm on center along intermediate framing members for 9.4 mm and 10.9 mm panels 
installed on studs spaced 600 mm on center. For other conditions and panel thickness, space fasteners maximum 
300 mm on center on intermediate supports. 
c. 9.4 mm panel thickness or siding with a span rating of 400 mm on center is the minimum recommended where 
applied directly to framing as exterior siding. For grooved panel siding, the nominal panel thickness is the 
thickness of the panel measured at the point of fastening. 
d. Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 75 mm nominal or wider. 
e. Values apply to all-veneer plywood. Thickness at point of fastening on panel edges governs shear values. 
f. 
Where panels are applied on both faces of a wall and fastener spacing is less than 150 mm on center on either 
side, panel joints shall be offset to fall on different framing members, or framing shall be 75 mm nominal or 
thicker at adjoining panel edges. 
g. In Seismic Design Category D, E or F, where shear design values exceed 5108 Newton per meter, all framing 
members receiving edge fastening from abutting panels shall be not less than a single 75 mm nominal member, 
or two 50 mm nominal members fastened together in accordance with Section 2306.1 to transfer the design 
shear value between framing members. Wood structural panel joint and sill plate nailing shall be staggered at 
all panel edges. See AWC SDPWS for sill plate size and anchorage requirements. 
h. Staples shall have a minimum crown width of 10.90 mm and shall be installed with their crowns parallel to the 
long dimension of the framing members. 
i. 
For shear loads of normal or permanent load duration as defined by the ANSI/AWC NDS, the values in the 
table above shall be multiplied by 0.63 or 0.56, respectively.

the fill exceeds 1.5 m benching shall be 
provided in accordance with Figure J-1. A key 
shall be provided that is at least 3 m in width 
and 600 mm in depth. 
J107.4 Fill material. Fill material shall not 
include organic, frozen or other deleterious 
materials. No rock or similar irreducible 
material greater than 300 mm in any dimension 
shall be included in fills. 
J107.5 Compaction. All fill material shall be 
compacted to 90 percent of maximum density 
as determined by ASTM D1557, Modified 
Proctor, in lifts not exceeding 300 mm in depth. 
J107.6 Maximum slope. The slope of fill 
surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for the 
intended use. Fill slopes steeper than one unit 
vertical in two units horizontal (50-percent 
slope) shall be justified by a geotechnical report 
or engineering data. 
J108 Setbacks 
J108.1 General. Cut and fill slopes shall be set 
back from the property lines in accordance with 
this section. Setback dimensions shall be 
measured perpendicular to the property line and 
shall be as shown in Figure J-2, unless 
substantiating data is submitted justifying 
reduced setbacks. 
J108.2 Top of slope. The setback at the top of 
a cut slope shall be not less than that shown in 
Figure J-2, or than is required to accommodate 
any required interceptor drains, whichever is 
greater. 
J108.3 Slope protection. Where required to 
protect adjacent properties at the toe of a slope 
from adverse effects of the grading, additional 
protection, approved by the building official, 
shall be included. Such protection may include 
but shall not be limited to: 
1. Setbacks greater than those required by 
Figure J-2. 
2. Provisions for retaining walls or similar 
construction. 
3. Erosion protection of the fill slopes. 
4. Provision for the control of surface 
waters. 
J109 Drainage and Terracing 
J109.1 General. 
Unless 
otherwise 
recommended 
by 
a 
registered 
design 
professional, drainage facilities and terracing 
shall be provided in accordance with the 
requirements of this section. 
Exception: Drainage facilities and terracing 
need not be provided where the ground slope is 
not steeper than one unit vertical in three units 
horizontal (33-percent slope). 
J109.2 Terraces. Terraces at least 1.8 m in 
width shall be established at not more than 9.1 
m vertical intervals on all cut or fill slopes to 
control surface drainage and debris. Suitable 
access shall be provided to allow for cleaning 
and maintenance. 
Where more than two terraces are required, one 
terrace, located at approximately mid-height, 
shall be at least 3.65 m in width. 
Swales or ditches shall be provided on terraces. 
They shall have a minimum gradient of one unit 
vertical in 20 units horizontal (5-percent slope) 
and shall be paved with concrete not less than 
75 mm in thickness, or with other materials 
suitable to the application. They shall have a 
depth not less than 300 mm and a width not less 
than 1.5 m. 
A single run of swale or ditch shall not collect 
runoff from a tributary area exceeding 1250 m2 
(projected) without discharging into a down 
drain. 
J109.3 Interceptor drains. Interceptor drains 
shall be installed along the top of cut slopes 
receiving drainage from a tributary width 
greater than 12.2 m, measured horizontally. 
They shall have a minimum depth of 300 mm 
and a minimum width of 900 mm. The slope 
shall be approved by the building official, but 
shall be not less than one unit vertical in 50 
units horizontal (2-percent slope). The drain 
shall be paved with concrete not less than 75 
mm in thickness, or by other materials suitable

to the application. Discharge from the drain 
shall be accomplished in a manner to prevent 
erosion and shall be approved by the building 
official. 
J109.4 Drainage across property lines. 
Drainage across property lines shall not exceed 
that which existed prior to grading. Excess or 
concentrated drainage shall be contained on site 
or directed to an approved drainage facility. 
Erosion of the ground in the area of discharge 
shall be prevented by installation of non-
erosive down drains or other devices. 
J110 Erosion Control 
J110.1 General. The faces of cut and fill 
slopes shall be prepared and maintained to 
control erosion. This control shall be permitted 
to consist of effective planting. 
Exception: Erosion control measures need not 
be provided on cut slopes not subject to erosion 
due to the erosion-resistant character of the 
materials. 
Erosion control for the slopes shall be installed 
as soon as practicable and prior to calling for 
final inspection. 
J110.2 Other devices. Where necessary, 
check dams, cribbing, riprap or other devices or 
methods shall be employed to control erosion 
and provide safety. 
J111 Referenced Standards 
These standards are listed here for 
guidance; however, for enforcement, they 
shall be adopted and/or approved by the 
appropriate governmental authority (SASO 
or SBCNC) as per their mandates, before 
considered part of this code.
